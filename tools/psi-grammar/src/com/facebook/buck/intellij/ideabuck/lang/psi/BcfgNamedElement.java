   * Implementation note:
   * Normally, one would just leave these methods unimplemented.
   * However, because this is built using two-pass generation, the
   * first pass needs an implementation (subclasses will not have it
   * defined yet), and the second pass will actually fill in
   * subclass implementations.
   *
   * A future improvement to the build would be to have two versions
   * of this file: one with a default implementation (like this) for
   * the first pass and one without an implementation for the second
   * pass so that subclasses without an implementation fail at compile
   * time.
