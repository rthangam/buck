/**
 * CxxInferCaptureRulesAggregator is used to aggregate all of the per-source CxxInferCapture rules
 * per-library, so that we can look them up in the build graph while only having a reference to our
 * cxx_library dependencies, rather than needing to traverse into per-source details of our
 * dependencies.
 *
 * <p>This is a pure metadata rule - all of the information in it could either be derived by
 * traversing the action graph, or could be kept in-memory using the correct datastructures, but
 * actually doing that refactoring is non-trivial. It cannot actually be built (nor even depended
 * on), but the CxxInferEnhancer relies on being able to look it up.
