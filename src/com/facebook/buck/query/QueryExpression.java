/**
 * Base class for expressions in the Buck query language.
 *
 * <p>All queries return a set of targets that match the query expression.
 *
 * <p>All queries must ensure that sufficient graph edges are created in the QueryEnvironment so
 * that all nodes in the result are correctly ordered according to the type of query. For example,
 * "deps" queries require that all the nodes in the transitive closure of its argument set are
 * correctly ordered w.r.t. each other algebraic set operations such as intersect and union are
 * inherently unordered.
 *
 * <h2>Package overview</h2>
 *
 * <p>This package consists of two basic class hierarchies. The first, {@code QueryExpression}, is
 * the set of different query expressions in the language, and the {@link #eval} method of each
 * defines the semantics. The result of evaluating a query is set of Buck {@code QueryTarget}s (a
 * file or build target). The set may be interpreted as either a set or as nodes of a DAG, depending
 * on the context.
 *
 * @param <NODE_TYPE> Type of the node in the {@link QueryEnvironment} this expression should be
 *     evaluated in the context of.
