/**
 * A specialized Executor that executes {@link DepsAwareTask}. This executor will attempt to
 * maintain maximum concurrency, while completing dependencies of each supplied work first.
 *
 * <p>It is guaranteed that the dependencies from {@link DepsAwareTask#getDepsSupplier()} will be
 * completed before the work itself is executed.
 *
 * <p>In terms of thread safety, it is guaranteed that for the same {@link DepsAwareTask}, its deps
 * supplier from {@link DepsAwareTask#getDepsSupplier()} will be executed before its callable from
 * {@link DepsAwareTask#getCallable()} is executed. That is, the supplier execution "happens before"
 * the callable execution, but potentially in different threads, where "happens before" is the
 * standard event ordering a -> b. There is an at least once guarantee on the number of invocations
 * of the deps supplier, and an exactly once guarantee on the callable. There is no guarantee of
 * synchronization between different instances of {@link DepsAwareTask} other than that its
 * dependencies will be completed before the callable is evaluated.
