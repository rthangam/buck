 * Indicates that a field or method of a class should be added to rulekeys when an instance of that
 * class is added to a rulekey.

 * automatically from this field/method.
 *
 * <p>Annotating a method with @AddToRuleKey should only be used for Immutable objects.
 *
 * <p>In general, this should be added to all fields unless there's a good reason not to add it. In
 * that case, annotated the field/method with @{@link ExcludeFromRuleKey} to indicate that not
 * adding it to the keys is intentional.
